## Identity Day 4 Custom Policies

- Took me 7 hours.
- I struggled with making a claim type for an integer. Most of the are for strings. So I made it a Role, and then converted it to int32.
- I learned how to create custom policies and how to add claims to identies and identities to a principle.
- I utilized the class demo, previous lab, and the videos.
